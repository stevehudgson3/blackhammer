colors <br/>
have a better color scheme

spotlight <br/>
keeps changing the height on each slide. not sure how to fix that

links <br/>
links should go to different parts of the website

javascript/css <br/>
add javascript or css that transitions the website's links nicely

buttons <br/>
make custom buttons that help with the color scheme

responsiveness <br/>
change the font of everything with media queries
find out if you need to use gulp to use different image sizes for different viewports
